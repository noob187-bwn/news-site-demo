      <p class="article-meta">By Waleed PD Mahdini ‚Ä¢ September 9, 2025</p>
      <div class="article-body">
<p> ‚ÄúThe legacy that we leave behind is built with the people. I told them that writing reports are easy but it is the action plans where the depth comes.‚Äù He then switched to the Singapore blueprint as a perfect example of achieving success. ‚ÄúIn Singapore, we do a lot of things ourselves and we learn to make mistakes because in this process, we learn. We train and we invest in our people and we make a lot of sacrifices to build up this depth. You must seek out and develop a cadre of young people who are committed to doing it themselves. They must also have confidence so it is important to find good, interested people and let them grow, especially in a young country. But they must be allowed to make mistakes. That‚Äôs where you learn. That is the key.‚Äù </p>

<p>Mr Yeo then elaborated this further by holding up his index finger to share in the three keys to making mistakes: ‚ÄúFirst, you have to admit your mistake. Second, apologise. Third rule, and this is the most important, don‚Äôt do it again,‚Äù he said with a knowing smile as he gestured with his three digits. ‚ÄúThe key is to learn from it and not to repeat it again. If you don‚Äôt make allowances for making mistakes, how are you going to learn by yourself? That is why it is very important to find dedicated and committed young people but you must also delegate some authority to them. Otherwise, you will be left with doing everything yourself. That way, everyone learns.‚Äù </p>

</div>
<p>Speaking about developing SMEs, Mr Yeo noted that ‚Äúyou must provide all kinds of incentives; you have to give them financing‚Äù. Pointing out that the last time he was in the Sultanate was in 1983; Mr Yeo reverted once again to the Singaporean example: ‚ÄúYou need to build deliberate policies to build that depth and you have to get the government to be pro-active in order to meet the service capacity and delivery time. In fact there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòhand-holding‚Äô.‚Äù </p>

<p>He has since extended this hand-holding further beyond the SMEs to the generations of Singaporean scholars. He recounted that during his tenure as the chairman of A*STAR, he set up a scholarship scheme to provide government-funded scholarships for 1,000 ‚Äústraight A students who could study any subject, except for Law and Economics‚Äù each year, who have since specialised in life sciences ‚Äì molecular biology, biochemistry, medicine, information technology and engineering. Asked why these subjects in particular, Mr Yeo replied with a grin, ‚ÄúBecause I never studied Law or Economics.‚Äù </p>

<p>Educated as an engineer, from which he moved onto a very successful career as an administrator and pioneering strategist for Singapore‚Äôs IT and biomedical sciences, one cannot help but appreciate the patience and personal commitment that he invests in each and every single scholarship student that is chosen. </p>

<p>One of his most outstanding hallmarks is his passion in developing people. Over the course of his career he has sent thousands of Singaporeans to top universities around the world on government funded scholarships, where in return after completing their tertiary or post graduate studies, these scholars make a commitment to return and serve the Singapore government for six years. Well-known for personally interviewing each scholarship candidate, Mr Yeo takes great pains to remember every personal detail about their family background and also closely monitors their academic performance. During his regular business trips abroad, he would take the time to meet up with up whichever student is studying at that particular city to find out about their welfare and studies. </p>

<p> ‚ÄúIn fact, when they get married, most of them will invite me and I try to attend most of them, if I have the time. And each one I give them ‚Äòang pow‚Äô. You know, a thousand students a year, that‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòang pow‚Äô, you know,‚Äù he said through a peal of laughter. </p>

<p>As he continued to leaf through his memories of particular students, noting that most of them chose partners within the scholarship community to marry and settle down, the theme of his prodigiously niche specialty in creating ‚Äòself-sufficient‚Äô or ‚Äòintegrated‚Äô communities comes to the fore.  </p>

<p>His keynote speech at the 29th CAEFO was on what he calls ‚Äúthe Singaporean blueprint for sustainable engineering‚Äù through the development of ‚Äúself-contained urbanisation‚Äù. Industry creates urbanisation, he pointed out, which is ‚Äúhappening everywhere and it is a fact of life‚Äù. As Brunei Darussalam is also beginning to fully embark on planning for its future land development, he presented two more successful Singaporean examples ‚Äì Biopolis and Fusionopolis. </p>

<p>Biopolis was the pioneering model for what would become an innovative blueprint that was emulated in other advanced countries for the designs of future cities ‚Äì one that is a complete environment for ‚Äúwork, live and play‚Äù. Initiated in 2001 and officially launched in October 2003, the first phase of the futuristic city concept ‚ÄòBiopolis‚Äô houses research institutes that specialises in genomics, bioinformatics, bioprocessing and bioengineering, which is part of the Singaporean government‚Äôs multibillion-dollar investment in biomedicine that is designed to nurture industries in biotechnology and pharmaceutical drugs. </p>

<p> ‚ÄúWith the technology available today, investing in the life sciences carries a big potential and even bigger opportunities as we try to improve our life sciences,‚Äù explained Mr Yeo. Now in its fourth phase, scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012, Biopolis has attracted some of the biggest names in biology to head its lavishly equipped facilities. </p>

<p>In February 2003, Singapore launched another futuristic concept called Fusionopolis that served as an extension of an information technology hub, in synergy with Biopolis. Described by Nature Magazine during its official opening in October 2008 as: ‚ÄúPart laboratory, part resort and part architectural gem, Fusionopolis is Singapore‚Äôs newest mega-science facility ‚Ä¶ Fusionopolis is the physical science sequel to Biopolis. Housing six institutes ‚Ä¶ the buildings are meant to spur interdisciplinary research not only among its own institutes but also with Biopolis.‚Äù </p>

<p>Explaining what Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong referred to Fusionopolis as ‚Äúan entire integrated innovation ecosystem‚Äù, Mr Yeo highlighted that ‚Äúfor urbanisation, you must first create jobs. From there you can then create an environment for work, with these jobs, a place to live and to live to play‚Äù. In fact this ‚Äòlive, work, play‚Äô theme is the central theme behind Mr Yeo‚Äôs vision for small clusters of self-contained ‚Äúliving cities‚Äù. He went on to point out: ‚ÄúWith work, you have to ensure that it is economically vibrant. From there, people will want to settle down and live, and you have to ensure that it is environmentally friendly and provides all the amenities from transportation to all these other social amenities. Finally you must also have recreational and entertainment centres for play, which must be socially harmonious. Once you have achieved all three, only then you will get sustainable development.‚Äù </p>

<p>This Singaporean blueprint has successfully been transplanted to other parts of the world. ‚ÄúWe have been creating urbanisation for neighbouring countries,‚Äù said Mr Yeo. </p>

<p>In 1991, Indonesia opened its Batamindo Industrial Park, which is home to 60,000 workers that also work there producing an export value of US$2billion. India followed suite in 1994 by opening up the International Technology Park in Bangalore in 1994 that is home to 27,000 IT personnel. Three such living cities have since been since created in Vietnam, named the Vietnam Singapore Industrial Park at Bac Ninh, Bin Duong and Hai Phong that collectively boasts just under 500 tenants and 100,000 workers that produce an export value of US$7billion. Singapore has also undertaken four similar projects in China ‚Äì the Tianjin Eco City, the Wuxi Industrial Park, Suzhou Industrial Park and the Guangzhou Knowledge City. </p>

<p>By understanding the mega trends of the day, which are rapid urbanisation, environmental improvement and social management, these future cities ‚Äúmust be sustainable, harmonious, convenient and resource efficient‚Äù, said Mr Yeo. </p>

<p> ‚ÄúSo you must take care of your young people, take care of how they serve and grow but you must also teach them to stand on their own two feet, through a lot of guidance and support by dedicated and committed mentors.‚Äù Asked where the best training ground was, he smiled and replied: ‚ÄúThere is no school better than the real world and the real working life. My generation of Singaporeans was lucky because we had good bosses and this is also very important to have understanding and fair-minded bosses. But ultimately, my hope is that the future generations will also have bosses who support them to build and nurture the next generation.‚Äù </p>      </div>
